# 🛡️ Operational-Governance Framework Mapping – ISO 27001 & NIST CSF Alignment
---
## **Overview**

This repository maps five key cybersecurity operational scenarios to major governance and compliance frameworks—**ISO 27001**, **NIST CSF**, and **SOC 2 Trust Principles**. Each scenario represents a critical control domain that supports proactive security, compliance maturity, and business resilience.

### **1. Incident Response & Threat Management**

**Category:** 🔹 **Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection**

**Explanation:** Focuses on proactive detection, containment, and mitigation of threats through SIEM tuning, monitoring, and structured response workflows.

*Related NIST Functions:* Detect (DE), Respond (RS)

*Supporting ISO 27001 Controls:* A.16 (Information Security Incident Management)

---

### **2. Vulnerability Remediation & Patch Prioritization**

**Category:** 🔹 **Risk Assessment & Threat Modeling**

**Explanation:** Vulnerability management is a core activity of assessing and mitigating risk exposure. It supports risk modeling by prioritizing remediation based on asset criticality and CVSS.

*Related NIST Functions:* Identify (ID.RA), Protect (PR.IP)

*Supporting ISO 27001 Controls:* A.12.6 (Technical Vulnerability Management)

---

### **3. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)**

**Category:** 🔹 **Metrics, Reporting & Executive Dashboards**

**Explanation:** BC/DR integrates governance and measurement—tracking RTO, RPO, recovery validation, and service uptime. These metrics inform risk and continuity dashboards for executive visibility.

*Related NIST Functions:* Recover (RC)

*Supporting ISO 27001 Controls:* A.17 (Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity)

---

### **4. Security Policy & Procedure Development**

**Category:** 🔹 **Security Architecture & Firewall/VPN Management (Governance Layer)**

**Explanation:** Policy and procedure development underpin the governance of network security. Defines access control, network segmentation, and configuration standards guiding firewall and VPN management.

*Related NIST Functions:* Identify (ID.GV), Protect (PR.IP)

*Supporting ISO 27001 Controls:* A.5 (Information Security Policies)

---

### **5. Cybersecurity Awareness & Phishing Simulation**

**Category:** 🔹 **Vendor & Third-Party Security Management (User Risk Management)**

**Explanation:** Awareness and phishing simulations address the human element of internal and external risk. They align with vendor-led awareness platforms and reduce social engineering threats.

*Related NIST Functions:* Protect (PR.AT)

*Supporting ISO 27001 Controls:* A.7.2.2 (Information Security Awareness, Education, and Training)
